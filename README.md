## Welcome to PyPortfolioOpt

<a href="https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><img src="https://github.com/PyPortfolio/PyPortfolioOpt/blob/main/media/logo_v1.png?raw=true" width="275" align="right" /></a>

PyPortfolioOpt is a library implementing portfolio optimization methods, including
classical mean-variance optimization, Black-Litterman allocation, or shrinkage and Hierarchical Risk Parity.
PyPortfolioOpt is inspired by scikit-learn; it is **extensive** yet easily **extensible**, for casual investors, or professionals looking for an easy prototyping tool. Whether you are a fundamentals-oriented investor who has identified a
handful of undervalued picks, or an algorithmic trader who has a basket of
strategies, PyPortfolioOpt can help you combine your alpha sources in a risk-efficient way.

## 🚀 Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install pyportfolioopt
```

### From source

Clone the repository, navigate to the folder, and install using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PyPortfolio/PyPortfolioOpt.git
cd PyPortfolioOpt
pip install .
```

## Getting started

Here is an example on real life stock data,
demonstrating how easy it is to find the long-only portfolio
that maximises the Sharpe ratio (a measure of risk-adjusted returns).

```python
import pandas as pd
from pypfopt import EfficientFrontier
from pypfopt import risk_models
from pypfopt import expected_returns

# Read in price data
df = pd.read_csv("tests/resources/stock_prices.csv", parse_dates=True, index_col="date")

# Calculate expected returns and sample covariance
mu = expected_returns.mean_historical_return(df)
S = risk_models.sample_cov(df)

# Optimize for maximal Sharpe ratio
ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S)
raw_weights = ef.max_sharpe()
cleaned_weights = ef.clean_weights()
ef.save_weights_to_file("weights.csv")  # saves to file

for name, value in cleaned_weights.items():
    print(f"{name}: {value:.4f}")
```

```result
GOOG: 0.0458
AAPL: 0.0674
FB: 0.2008
BABA: 0.0849
AMZN: 0.0352
GE: 0.0000
AMD: 0.0000
WMT: 0.0000
BAC: 0.0000
GM: 0.0000
T: 0.0000
UAA: 0.0000
SHLD: 0.0000
XOM: 0.0000
RRC: 0.0000
BBY: 0.0159
MA: 0.3287
PFE: 0.2039
JPM: 0.0000
SBUX: 0.0173
```

```python
exp_return, volatility, sharpe=ef.portfolio_performance(verbose=True)

round(exp_return, 4), round(volatility, 4), round(sharpe, 4)
```

```result
Expected annual return: 29.9%
Annual volatility: 21.8%
Sharpe Ratio: 1.38
```

This is interesting but not useful in itself.
However, PyPortfolioOpt provides a method which allows you to
convert the above continuous weights to an actual allocation
that you could buy. Just enter the most recent prices, and the desired portfolio size ($10,000 in this example):

```python
from pypfopt.discrete_allocation import DiscreteAllocation, get_latest_prices

latest_prices = get_latest_prices(df)

da = DiscreteAllocation(cleaned_weights, latest_prices, total_portfolio_value=10000)
allocation, leftover = da.greedy_portfolio()
for name, value in allocation.items():
    print(f"{name}: {value}")

print("Funds remaining: ${:.2f}".format(leftover))
```

```result
MA: 19
PFE: 57
FB: 12
BABA: 4
AAPL: 4
GOOG: 1
SBUX: 2
BBY: 2
Funds remaining: $17.46
```

## An overview of classical portfolio optimization methods

Harry Markowitz's 1952 paper is the undeniable classic,
which turned portfolio optimization from an art into a science.
The key insight is that by combining assets with different expected returns and volatilities,
one can decide on a mathematically optimal allocation which minimises
the risk for a target return – the set of all such optimal portfolios is referred to as the **efficient frontier**.

<center>
<img src="https://github.com/PyPortfolio/PyPortfolioOpt/blob/main/media/efficient_frontier_white.png?raw=true" style="width:60%;"/>
</center>

Although much development has been made in the subject, more than half a century later,
Markowitz's core ideas are still fundamentally important and see daily use in many portfolio management firms.
The main drawback of mean-variance optimization is that the theoretical
treatment requires knowledge of the expected returns and the future risk-characteristics (covariance) of the assets. Obviously, if we knew the expected returns of a stock life would be much easier, but the whole game is that stock returns are notoriously hard to forecast. As a substitute, we can derive estimates of the expected return and covariance based on historical data – though we do lose the theoretical guarantees provided by Markowitz, the closer our estimates are to the real values, the better our portfolio will be.

Thus this project provides four major sets of functionality (though of course they are intimately related)

- Estimates of expected returns
- Estimates of risk (i.e covariance of asset returns)
- Objective functions to be optimized
- Optimizers.

A key design goal of PyPortfolioOpt is **modularity** – the user should be able to swap in their
components while still making use of the framework that PyPortfolioOpt provides.

## Features

In this section, we detail some of PyPortfolioOpt's available functionality. More examples are offered in the Jupyter notebooks [here](https://github.com/pyportfolio/pyportfolioopt/tree/main/cookbook). Another good resource is the [tests](https://github.com/pyportfolio/pyportfolioopt/tree/main/tests).

A far more comprehensive version of this can be found on [ReadTheDocs](https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), as well as possible extensions for more advanced users.

### Expected returns

- Mean historical returns:
  - the simplest and most common approach, which states that the expected return of each asset is equal to the mean of its historical returns.
  - easily interpretable and very intuitive
- Exponentially weighted mean historical returns:
  - similar to mean historical returns, except it gives exponentially more weight to recent prices
  - it is likely the case that an asset's most recent returns hold more weight than returns from 10 years ago when it comes to estimating future returns.
- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):
  - a simple model to predict returns based on the beta to the market
  - this is used all over finance!
- Fama-French 3-factor model:
  - estimates expected returns using exposures to market, size, and value factors
- Fama-French 5-factor model:
  - extends FF3 with profitability and investment factors

### Risk models (covariance)

The covariance matrix encodes not just the volatility of an asset, but also how it correlated to other assets. This is important because in order to reap the benefits of diversification (and thus increase return per unit risk), the assets in the portfolio should be as uncorrelated as possible.

- Sample covariance matrix:
  - an unbiased estimate of the covariance matrix
  - relatively easy to compute
  - the de facto standard for many years
  - however, it has a high estimation error, which is particularly dangerous in mean-variance optimization because the optimizer is likely to give excess weight to these erroneous estimates.
- Semicovariance: a measure of risk that focuses on downside variation.
- Exponential covariance: an improvement over sample covariance that gives more weight to recent data
- Covariance shrinkage: techniques that involve combining the sample covariance matrix with a structured estimator, to reduce the effect of erroneous weights. PyPortfolioOpt provides wrappers around the efficient vectorised implementations provided by `sklearn.covariance`.
  - manual shrinkage
  - Ledoit Wolf shrinkage, which chooses an optimal shrinkage parameter. We offer three shrinkage targets: `constant_variance`, `single_factor`, and `constant_correlation`.
  - Oracle Approximating Shrinkage
- Minimum Covariance Determinant:
  - a robust estimate of the covariance
  - implemented in `sklearn.covariance`

### Objective functions

- Maximum Sharpe ratio: this results in a _tangency portfolio_ because on a graph of returns vs risk, this portfolio corresponds to the tangent of the efficient frontier that has a y-intercept equal to the risk-free rate. This is the default option because it finds the optimal return per unit risk.
- Minimum volatility. This may be useful if you're trying to get an idea of how low the volatility _could_ be, but in practice it makes a lot more sense to me to use the portfolio that maximises the Sharpe ratio.
- Efficient return, a.k.a. the Markowitz portfolio, which minimises risk for a given target return – this was the main focus of Markowitz 1952
- Efficient risk: the Sharpe-maximising portfolio for a given target risk.
- Maximum quadratic utility. You can provide your own risk-aversion level and compute the appropriate portfolio.

### Adding constraints or different objectives

- Long/short: by default all of the mean-variance optimization methods in PyPortfolioOpt are long-only, but they can be initialised to allow for short positions by changing the weight bounds:

```python
ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S, weight_bounds=(-1, 1))
```

- Market neutrality: for the `efficient_risk` and `efficient_return` methods, PyPortfolioOpt provides an option to form a market-neutral portfolio (i.e weights sum to zero). This is not possible for the max Sharpe portfolio and the min volatility portfolio because in those cases because they are not invariant with respect to leverage. Market neutrality requires negative weights:

```python
ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S, weight_bounds=(-1, 1))
for name, value in ef.efficient_return(target_return=0.2, market_neutral=True).items():
    print(f"{name}: {value:.4f}")
```

AAPL: 0.0532

```

- Minimum/maximum position size: it may be the case that you want no security to form more than 10% of your portfolio. This is easy to encode:

```python
ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S, weight_bounds=(0, 0.1))
```

One issue with mean-variance optimization is that it leads to many zero-weights. While these are
"optimal" in-sample, there is a large body of research showing that this characteristic leads
mean-variance portfolios to underperform out-of-sample. To that end, I have introduced an
objective function that can reduce the number of negligible weights for any of the objective functions. Essentially, it adds a penalty (parameterised by `gamma`) on small weights, with a term that looks just like L2 regularisation in machine learning. It may be necessary to try several `gamma` values to achieve the desired number of non-negligible weights. For the test portfolio of 20 securities, `gamma ~ 1` is sufficient

```python
from pypfopt import objective_functions
ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S)
ef.add_objective(objective_functions.L2_reg, gamma=1)
for name, value in ef.max_sharpe().items():
    print(f"{name}: {value:.4f}")
```

### Black-Litterman allocation

Pyportfolioopt supports Black-Litterman asset allocation, which allows you to combine
a prior estimate of returns (e.g the market-implied returns) with your own views to form a
posterior estimate. This results in much better estimates of expected returns than just using
the mean historical return. Check out the [docs](https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/BlackLitterman.html) for a discussion of the theory, as well as advice
on formatting inputs.

```python
from pypfopt import risk_models, BlackLittermanModel

S = risk_models.sample_cov(df)
viewdict = {"AAPL": 0.20, "BBY": -0.30, "BAC": 0, "SBUX": -0.2, "T": 0.131321}
bl = BlackLittermanModel(S, pi="equal", absolute_views=viewdict, omega="default")
rets = bl.bl_returns()

ef = EfficientFrontier(rets, S)
for name, value in ef.max_sharpe().items():
    print(f"{name}: {value:.4f}")
```

### Other optimizers

The features above mostly pertain to solving mean-variance optimization problems via quadratic programming (though this is taken care of by `cvxpy`). However, we offer different optimizers as well:

- Mean-semivariance optimization
- Mean-CVaR optimization
- Hierarchical Risk Parity, using clustering algorithms to choose uncorrelated assets
- Markowitz's critical line algorithm (CLA)

Please refer to the [documentation](https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OtherOptimizers.html) for more.

## Advantages over existing implementations

- Includes both classical methods (Markowitz 1952 and Black-Litterman), suggested best practices
  (e.g covariance shrinkage), along with many recent developments and novel
  features, like L2 regularisation, shrunk covariance, hierarchical risk parity.
- Native support for pandas dataframes: easily input your daily prices data.
- Extensive practical tests, which use real-life data.
- Easy to combine with your proprietary strategies and models.
- Robust to missing data, and price-series of different lengths (e.g FB data
  only goes back to 2012 whereas AAPL data goes back to 1980).

## Project principles and design decisions

- It should be easy to swap out individual components of the optimization process
  with the user's proprietary improvements.
- Usability is everything: it is better to be self-explanatory than consistent.
- There is no point in portfolio optimization unless it can be practically
  applied to real asset prices.
- Everything that has been implemented should be tested.
- Inline documentation is good: dedicated (separate) documentation is better.
  The two are not mutually exclusive.
- Formatting should never get in the way of coding: because of this,
  I have deferred **all** formatting decisions to [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

## Testing

Tests are written in pytest (much more intuitive than `unittest` and the variants in my opinion), and I have tried to ensure close to 100% coverage. Run the tests by navigating to the package directory and simply running `pytest` on the command line.

PyPortfolioOpt provides a test dataset of daily returns for 20 tickers:

```python
['GOOG', 'AAPL', 'FB', 'BABA', 'AMZN', 'GE', 'AMD', 'WMT', 'BAC', 'GM', 'T', 'UAA', 'SHLD', 'XOM', 'RRC', 'BBY', 'MA', 'PFE', 'JPM', 'SBUX']
```

These tickers have been informally selected to meet several criteria:

- reasonably liquid
- different performances and volatilities
- different amounts of data to test robustness

Currently, the tests have not explored all of the edge cases and combinations
of objective functions and parameters. However, each method and parameter has
been tested to work as intended.
